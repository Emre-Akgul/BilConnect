## Our Vision
BilConnect’s vision is a Bilkent Campus that is connected both online and offline.

## Our Mission
Bilconnect’s mission is to create an exclusive social platform that enables our vision through threads for Bilkenters to communicate in real time and acts as an open bazaar where people can enjoy Bilkent’s exclusive market.

## Our Motivation
Our web app was inspired by our experiences selling our used books and equipment. Let Go, and similar apps were too generalized to sell our extremely specialized school equipment. Not using these apps, however, presented us with another problem: the lack of communication channels on our campus. Though Instagram pages such as bilkent_itiraf_ediyor try to fill that void, they fall short since they don’t permit live chatting and are not controlled by people from the student body.

We at BilConnect decided on a web app exclusive to Bilkenters, and solving this issue could be beneficial to Bilkent. Our team decided to develop an app that will enable online communication and enhance campus life.

## Features

#### Posts: 
Users can look for or create posts for **selling second-hand items**, **helping users to find their lost item**, **borrowing items for a specific time period**, **donating items**, **finding travel mate to split gas price**, **requesting donation**, **adopting animals**, and **selling or giving the event tickets** in the Bilkent community.

#### Tag System: 
Each post will have the main tag like **second-hand items**, **lost items** etc. and a sub-tag like **CS223 Item**, **lost jewellery** etc. With the help of this tag system, users can personalize their feeds and make an advanced search among posts.

#### User Feed: 
Users can see the posts containing the tag that they follow in their feed. Moreover, they can save the posts to find them later and access them on their saved feed page.

#### Search: 
Users can search for the post by using keywords, filtering tags, and filtering prices and sort the results according to different parameters. They can easily find what they need and save them.

#### Messaging: 
Communication is the key tool for BilConnect. Users can easily connect with post owners by quickly messaging them privately.

#### Security: 
Only Bilkent University members can access BilConnect, and this provides security and trust in the user community. Users can rate the other user after the finished activity, and this rating point affects their trust score. 

#### User Profiles: 
Users can personalize their profiles. Also, they can check the other users' profiles to see their past activity, active posts and trust score.

#### User Feedback: 
Users can share their feedback and experience about BilConnect with admins.

#### Action Logs: 
Saved action logs help admins to catch bugs and improve BilConnect.

#### Chatting Forum
Our social platform will have a one-to-one conversation option for individual conversations and a thread function for groups. From a separate search function from the bazaar, the members will be able to search for each other and threads. Members will then be able to friend each other and chat. These chats will allow for voice, image and video transfer. Threads, on the other hand, will contain multiple people. They will initially be created by other members and be used by all who join the thread. Though the threads are open to everyone by default, we will allow the functionality to be private and restrict these threads. For example, threads with your friend group can be private, making it invisible by search and only joinable by invite. On the other hand, a thread used by a school club might be restricted, it will show in the search function, but the contents will not be visible unless your join application is approved by the admins. Messages in these threads can be liked and disliked. This voting procedure will show the community’s position on the subject and determine if the message will make it to your personal feed or not. Your feed is another way to interact with your threads. It will show you the most popular, controversial comments of the past 24 hours, which you can view in context by clicking them. 

## Selling Points
Bilconnect is specifically designed for Bilkent University's campus. Since the platform is exclusively for the Bilkent community, there's a high level of trust. Users know they are interacting with fellow students or staff, reducing the risk of scams or fraud. In addition, exclusiveness allows faster transaction times and even better, there is no need to worry about shipping and delivery fees. 

Bilconnect offers a comprehensive solution to different problems. There is no need to visit different websites for selling, buying, renting and donating.

Bilconnect tries its best to ensure safety by using verified profiles and showing user reviews.

Bilconnect is more than a second-hand selling app, it also serves the purpose of connecting individuals on campus.

Bilconnect encourages sustainable practices by promoting the selling, renting and donating of items. It will be helpful for everyone by encouraging a circular economy on campus.

## What Makes Us Special?
Our web app presents a fresh outlook on social media and an exclusive marketplace to buy from and sell to Bilkenters. An app is a tool that can help clubs coordinate, and other groups on the campus communicate.
