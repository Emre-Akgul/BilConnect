# BilConnect
      
## Our Vision
BilConnect’s vision is a Bilkent Campus that is connected both online and offline.

## Our Mission
Bilconnect’s mission is to create an exclusive social platform that enables our vision through threads for Bilkenters to communicate in real-time and acts as an open bazaar where people can enjoy Bilkent’s exclusive market.

## Our Motivation
Our web app was inspired by our experiences selling our used books and equipment. Let Go and similar apps were too generalized to sell our extremely specialized school equipment. Not using these apps however presented us with another problem: the lack of communication channels on our campus. Though Instagram pages such as Bilken_itiraf_ediyor try to fill that void, they fall short since they don’t permit live chatting and are not controlled by people from the student body.
We at Bilconnect decided a web app exclusive to Bilkenters and solves this issue could be beneficial to Bilkent. Our team decided to develop an app that will enable online communication and enhance campus life.

## Features
As a team, we designed two main functions for BilCOnnect: the threads acting like a social platform and the bazaar acting like an online market.

### The Bazaar
The bazaar is a marketplace with a special focus on Bilkent students. It allows members to create listings of second-hand goods such as school books, technological equipment, furniture, concert tickets and anything a university student might need. Listings can also be created regarding donations, mentorship in courses and animals without shelter. These listings are then presented to other members on their home page and if it meets their criteria in our search function. If any members are interested, we provide a one-on-one live chat so the parties can negotiate the price and a place to meet up so the transaction can take place. The members will be able to rate each other and see what the seller previously sold. 

### The Social Platform
Our social platform will have a one-to-one conversation option for individual conversations and a thread function for groups. From a separate search function from the bazaar, the members will be able to search for each other and threads. Members will then be able to friend each other and chat. These chats will allow for voice, image and video transfer. Threads on the other hand will contain multiple people. They will initially be created by other members and be used by all who join the thread. Though the threads are open to everyone by default, we will allow the functionality to private and restrict these threads. For example, threads with your friend group can be private, making it invisible by search and only joinable by invite. On the other hand, a thread used by a school club might be restricted, it will show in the search function but the contents will not be visible unless your join application is approved by the admins.
Messages in these threads can be liked and disliked. This voting procedure will show the community’s position on the subject and determine if the message will make it to your personal feed or not. Your feed is another way to interact with your threads. It will show you the most popular, controversial comments of the past 24 hours which you can view in context by clicking them. 

## What Makes Us Special?
Our web app presents a fresh outlook on social media and an exclusive marketplace to buy from and sell to Bilkenters. The app is a tool that can help clubs coordinate and other groups on the campus communicate.
