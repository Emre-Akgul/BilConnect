## Our Vision
At BilConnect, we envision a Bilkent Campus where students, faculty, and staff are seamlessly connected both online and offline.

## Our Mission
Our mission is to create an exclusive social platform that realizes our vision. We aim to achieve this by providing a space for Bilkenters to engage in real-time communication and by establishing an open marketplace where members of the Bilkent community can enjoy exclusive deals and exchanges.

## What Inspired Us
Our journey began with a simple problem: the difficulty of selling highly specialized school equipment on generalized platforms like Let Go. On the other hand, not using such platforms left us with another challenge—the lack of effective communication channels on our campus. Instagram pages like "bilkent_itiraf_ediyor" attempted to bridge this gap but fell short as they lacked live chatting functionality and weren't student-controlled.

So, we decided to take matters into our own hands. BilConnect was born out of our desire to create a web app exclusively for Bilkenters, one that could address both the communication and transactional needs of our community.
